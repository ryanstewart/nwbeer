                <a href="http://www.nwpeaksbrewery.com/beer/easton-blonde-belgian/">Easton Blonde (Belgian)</a>  The name: This beer is named for our route up Mt Baker (the glacier). The Easton glacier sits on the S side of Mt Baker, and is one of the two most common routes up the volcano... The beer:  Easton Blonde is a Belgian blonde.  It has a slight sweetness to it, but is dominated by the peppery and phenolic notes that are typical of Belgian style yeasts ...
            </p>
            <p>
                <a href="http://www.nwpeaksbrewery.com/beer/nw-peaks-black-blonde/">NW Peaks Black Blonde</a>  The style. We modeled this after a schwarzbier (black pilsner) and since a "pilsner" fermented with an ale yeast is usually classified as a blonde, by analogy we called this a "black blonde."  The Beer. ... a nice balance between the residual malt sweetness,  light floral hop character, and minimal roast notes from the dark malts.

                <a href="http://www.nwpeaksbrewery.com/beer/magic-brown-2/">Magic Brown</a>  The mountain. Magic is situated right off of Cacade pass ... one of the "must go to" areas of the N Cascades, with several options for continuing the trip, including over to Magic and it's environs.  The beer.  Unlike the typical "brown," we built this brown up to have some more residual malt character by adding some extra munich, caramunich, and other specialty malts, but keeping the overall alcohol content and roast character down.
            </p>
            <p>
                <a href="http://www.nwpeaksbrewery.com/beer/colchuck-pale/">Colchuck Pale</a>  The mountain. Colchuck is part of the Stuart range, If timed correctly the descent from the summit can offer a 3000' glissade back to the lake (just not into the lake), or better yet, a nice spring back country ski. The beer. Colchuck is a light pale ale with just enough malt character to support the hop aroma and flavor. The aroma has a nice, distinctive grapefruit character to it and is on the forefront but not overpowering

                <a href="http://www.nwpeaksbrewery.com/beer/esmeralda2/">Esmeralda Ale (take 2)</a>  The story of two experiences. ...our first batch with the new brewhouse was best described as a comedy of errors while our second time on the brewhouse went much smoother with no issues to report.  The unique character in this beer comes from the addition of corn and molasses, A great beer with a unique sort of complexity.
            </p>
            <p>
                <a href="http://www.nwpeaksbrewery.com/beer/hannegan-red/">Hannegan Red</a>  The mountain.

            <p>
                <a href="http://www.nwpeaksbrewery.com/beer/stuart-stout-2/">Stuart Stout</a>  The mountain: Mt Stuart is the second tallest non-volcanic peak in WA and can be identified from nearly any high summit...  The Beer.  Stuart Stout a rich, full bodied, deeply roasty interpretation of the style.  A fine beer to drink anytime, but best enjoyed in front of a fire on a cold rainy winter evening.
            </p>
            <p>
                <a href="http://www.nwpeaksbrewery.com/beer/early-morning-stout/">Early Morning Stout</a>  Early Morning Spire is set in a magical location of the Eldorado, Inspiration, and Mcallister glaciers... The name derives itself from a group that had to bivy near the summit (cold, unprepared), which caused them to summit just after first light. What better of a beer style to have at first light than a stout? ... The Beer. An "American stout," it has a nice roast and chocolate aroma/flavor but also includes a significant amount of NW hops...

            <h3>January, 2012</h3>
            <p>
                <a href="http://www.nwpeaksbrewery.com/beer/maudes-mild/">Maude's mild</a>  Mt Maude is the 13th tallest peak in WA and helps comprise the cirque where the Entiat river starts its seaward journey....  Maude's mild is our interpretation of a winter session beer. Milds are, by definition, a lower strength beer and this one gets it's subtle warming from notes of dark fruits: prunes and raisins.
            </p>
            <p>
                <a href="http://www.nwpeaksbrewery.com/beer/esmeralda-ale/">Esmeralda Ale</a>  The name. The mountain. Esmeralda is located in the Teanaway River drainage just S of Ingalls peak and SW of MT Stuart - one of our favorite areas.... While the mountain is great, this beers namesake comes from our tale of two experiences that parallel the brewery.... The Beer. Compared to Maude's mild, Esmeralda has a higher alcohol level...  with some dark sugars allowing notes of molasses and dark sugar to complement the extra alcohol.

            <p>
                <a href="http://www.nwpeaksbrewery.com/beer/picket-porter/">Picket Porter</a>  The name. The mountain (range). The rugged Picket Range is located in the North Cascades National Park and so named for its resemblance to a picket fence...   The Beer. We attempted to make picket porter a perfect partner to the Snowfield winter: A very flavorful beer but yet easy drinking with a lower alcohol content.  It is very drinkable and has a lower alcohol content that would be similar to the historical versions of the entires...
            </p>
            <p>
                <a href="http://www.nwpeaksbrewery.com/beer/snowfield-winter-2011/">Snowfield Winter 2011 </a>  The name. The mountain. With a name like Snowfield, we couldn’t resist naming our winter beer after it. ...Washington’s 90th highest peak, it stands 6,500′ above the Pyramid Lake trailhead with multiple ‘ups and downs’ and glaciers en route... The Beer. This is our second season of the Snowfield. We made this year’s version based on previous batches, but changing things up to hit a new season. ... a slightly more bitter and hop forward beer that is nicely balanced by the chocolaty, sweet malt backbone and higher alcohol %.

The N Cascades has its own version, Little Annapurna, named because of the similar appearance to its Himalayan counterpart. The Beer. We wanted to make a darker beer that had a lot of hop character blending the recent harvest with the upcoming winter. We'll call it a NW Black ale...

            <p>
                <a href="http://www.nwpeaksbrewery.com/beer/spickard-spiced-ale/">Spickard Spiced Ale</a>  The mountain. Spickard is juxtaposed to Mt Redoubt and is a great alpine destination, although accessibility is limited to put it mildly. The Beer. We went towards Thanksgiving spices. We started with a base that includes more than 25% maize... then added some spruce, rosemary, and thyme...
